# CodingCurriculum
Base curriculum for the ITA and R2H Tech programs

All assignments will be given in the [Code2Hire/CodingCurriculum](https://github.com/Code2Hire/CodingCurriculum) repo and are due on Mondays at noon.

Do not clone this repo! **Fork it!** This will create your own personal copy that won't impact the original repo. Instructions are located at [https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).

Make sure you follow step 3 in that article and keep your forked repo up-to-date with the original. 

## Initial Computer Setup

There are a few things you'll need to install to get started. First, install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

Next, install Xcode. Open iTerm2 and type:

> xcode-select —install

Then, install Homebrew. In the terminal you just used, type:

> ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
